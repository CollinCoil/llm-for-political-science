Summary 1: ts and provide for the general Welfare of the United States." Art. I, 8, cl. 1. Congress may use this power to establish cooperative state-federal Spending Clause programs.

Summary 1: The provision of the individual mandate does not provide the necessary justification for the expansion of Medicaid. The provision does not allow Congress to impose a tax on individuals who do not comply with the provision. The provisions of the Affordable Care Act provide for the provision of shared responsibility payments, which cannot be used as a means of imposing a tax.
Summary 2: The provision of the individual mandate does not provide the necessary justification for the expansion of Medicaid. The provision does not allow Congress to impose a tax on individuals who do not comply with the provision. The provisions of the Affordable Care Act provide for the provision of shared responsibility payments, which cannot be used as an instrument for imposing a tax. However, the provision is severable from the rest of the Constitution. This review demonstrates that the provision cannot be applied to any individual country. It is therefore clear to the Government that Congress cannot exercise its discretionary power to impose tax on people who fail to comply with a provision in the health care legislation. The interpretation of this review should be interpreted with caution, however, as it relates to several other important issues.

Summary 1:  in 2010 , Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in order to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care. under the Affordable Care Act , the individual mandate is transformed into a program to cover the health care needs of the entire nonelderly population with income below 133 percent of the poverty level . 
 those who do not comply with the mandate must make a "shared responsibility payment" to the Federal Government . 
 the payment is collected solely by the IRS through the normal means of taxation . 
 the present challenge seeks to restrain the collection of the shared responsibility payment from those who do not comply with the individual mandate . 
 the most straightforward reading of the individual mandate is that it commands individuals to purchase insurance. But the mandate need not be read to declare that failing to do so is unlawful. 
 it may also be read as imposing a tax on those who go without insurance.    
 the individual mandate thus violates
